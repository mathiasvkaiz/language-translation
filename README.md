# language-translation

## ## Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree - Project 4
In this project, you’re going to take a peek into the realm of neural network machine translation. You’ll be training a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.

### Install
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- Python 3.5
- pandas 
- matplotlib 
- scipy scikit-learn

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

To install tensorflow use command:
```pip install tensorflow```


### Code
This project contains one folder:
- /data/:  
French and english translation texts

This project also contains three files:

- dlnd_language_translation.ipynb:  
This is the main file where you will answer questions and provide an analysis for your work. 
- problem_unittests.py:  
Unit test file
- helper.py:  
Helper code. Do not modify.
  
### Run
In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the project files, and then use the command:  
```jupyter notebook dlnd_language_translation.ipynb```
